---

# AI Fundamentals

**Artificial Intelligence**: Systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence

**Key Components:**
- **Machine Learning**: Systems that improve through experience
- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI trained on vast text datasets to understand and generate language

---

# How Modern AI Works (Simplified)

```
Training Data → Model Training → Inference
    📚            🧠             💬
Massive text    Learning        Generating
corpus          patterns        responses
```

1. **Training**: AI learns patterns from enormous datasets
2. **Fine-tuning**: Specialized training for specific tasks

# Addressing Concerns & Best Practices

---

# Common Concerns in Our Organization

**🔐 Security & Privacy**
- "What data is being sent to AI services?"
- "Can our proprietary code be exposed?"

**📊 Quality & Reliability**  
- "How do we know the AI output is correct?"
- "What about hallucinations and errors?"

**⚖️ Ethics & Responsibility**
- "Are we replacing human developers?"
- "What about data provenance and bias?"

**📝 Compliance**
- "Does this meet our government standards?"
- "What about audit trails and accountability?"

---

# Security & Privacy Best Practices

**🛡️ Data Protection:**
- Use tools that process data locally when possible
- Review terms of service and data handling policies
- Avoid sharing sensitive/classified information
- Consider on-premises or government cloud solutions

**🔒 Code Security:**
- Never share proprietary algorithms or sensitive logic
- Use AI for generic patterns, not business-specific code
- Implement code review processes for AI-generated code
- Sanitize examples before sharing with external AI

**✅ Approved Tools:** Work with IT security to establish approved AI tools list

---

# Quality & Reliability Guidelines

**🔍 Always Verify:**
- Treat AI output as a starting point, not final solution
- Test all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Have human review for critical systems
- Maintain coding standards regardless of source

**📚 Request Sources:**
- Ask AI: "What sources inform this recommendation?"
- "Can you provide documentation links?"
- "What are the potential drawbacks of this approach?"

**🧪 Validation Process:**
```
AI Suggestion → Human Review → Testing → Integration
```

---

# Responsible Adoption Framework

**For Skeptics - Start Here:**
1. **Discussion Only**: Use AI for brainstorming and learning
2. **Ask for Sources**: "Where can I verify this information?"
3. **Compare Options**: "What are alternatives to this approach?"
