# What is AI? 
## (The Obligatory 10,000-Foot View)

---

# AI Fundamentals

**Artificial Intelligence**: Systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence

**Key Components:**
- **Machine Learning**: Systems that improve through experience
- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI trained on vast text datasets to understand and generate language

---

# How Modern AI Works (Simplified)

```
Training Data → Model Training → Inference
    📚            🧠             💬
Massive text    Learning        Generating
corpus          patterns        responses
```

1. **Training**: AI learns patterns from enormous datasets

# Progressive Adoption Strategy

**🟢 Start Small (Low Risk)**
```
Documentation → Learning → Discussion
```

**🟡 Build Confidence (Medium Risk)**  
```
Code Review → Architecture Planning → Prototyping
```

**🔴 Full Integration (Higher Risk)**
```
Production Code → Automated Workflows → Critical Systems
```

**Remember:** You control the pace and scope of adoption

# Addressing Concerns & Best Practices

---

# 1. Am I risking leaking data? What am I allowed to use?

**� Data Protection Guidelines:**
- Use private (NNPP) services where possible and appropriate
- Do not enter Program information into public services
- See CP-207 (Corporate Policy for Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence) for more information

---

# 2. How do I know the AI is right? What about hallucinations?

**🔍 Always Verify:**
- Treat AI output as a starting point, not final solution
- Test all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Maintain coding standards regardless of source

**� Ask Follow-up Questions:**
- "What sources inform this recommendation?"
- "Can you provide documentation links?"
- "What are the potential drawbacks of this approach?"

---

# 3. Is this stealing? What about data provenance?

**⚖️ Ethical Considerations:**
- AI/model developers are increasingly focused on responsible and ethical sourcing
- Major companies are investing in transparent data provenance practices

**🤔 For Skeptics - Start Here:**
- **Discussion Only**: Use AI for brainstorming and learning, not code generation
- **Ask for Sources**: "Where can I verify this information?" and cross-check responses

---

# Looking Ahead

---

# Next Steps as an Organization

- Leverage Developer Forums as opportunities for AI knowledge shares
- Select non-critical projects for AI experimentation
- Measure impact on productivity and code quality
- Develop and refine local adoption guidelines based on experience
- Stay current with evolving AI capabilities
