# Addressing Concerns & Best Practices

---

# 1. Am I risking leaking data? What am I allowed to use?

**ÔøΩ Data Protection Guidelines:**
- Use private (NNPP) services where possible and appropriate
- Do not enter Program information into public services
- See CP-207 (Corporate Policy for Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence) for more information

---

# 2. How do I know the AI is right? What about hallucinations?

**üîç Always Verify:**
- Treat AI output as a starting point, not final solution
- Test all AI-generated code thoroughly
- Maintain coding standards regardless of source

**ÔøΩ Ask Follow-up Questions:**
- "What sources inform this recommendation?"
- "Can you provide documentation links?"
- "What are the potential drawbacks of this approach?"

---

# 3. Is this stealing? What about data provenance?

**‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations:**
- AI/model developers are increasingly focused on responsible and ethical sourcing
- Major companies are investing in transparent data provenance practices

**ÔøΩ Ask Follow-up Questions:**
- "What sources were used to generate this answer?"
- "Can you provide links to sources?"
- "Where can I verify this information?"
